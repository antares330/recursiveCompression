    "Some other ideas for changing the cycle, is to use a 5/5 bit cycle, where the chance of double digit becomes smaller (the 1 representing an \"8\", needs to be active AND a \"2\" or a \"4\"), this gives us better odds to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea is to use a XOR gate (if it's 1, it toggles to 0, and if it's 0, it toggles to 1). If we have many high value binary numbers consistently, an XOR may be able to reduce the number of 1's.\n",
